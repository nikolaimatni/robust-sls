We now use the tools developed in the previous section to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the robust stability and robust performance of a system \eqref{eq:dynamics} subject to bounded perturbations in its $\A$ and $\B$ operators.  In particular consider the system
\begin{equation}
\tf x = \Sp(\A_0 + \DA)\x + \Sp(\B_0 + \DB)\uu + \Sp w,
\label{eq:uncertain-dynamics}
\end{equation}
where $\A_0 = \mathrm{blkdiag}(A,A,\dots)$ and $\B_0 = \mathrm{blkdiag}(B,B,\dots)$ are memoryless LTI operators defining a nominal LTI system $x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t$, and $\DA$ and $\DB$ are $\ell_\infty$-stable and satisfy 
\begin{equation}
\linffnorm{[\DA,\, \DB]}\leq \eps.
\label{eq:eps-bound}
\end{equation}
We first identify SLS based necessary and sufficient conditions for robust stability, and then build upon those to formulate a robust performance problem.  

We consider the following robust control problem: find a LTI controller $\tf K : \ell_\infty^{n,e} \to \ell_\infty^{p,e}$ such that the dynamics \eqref{eq:  



Define the controlled output signal as 
\begin{equation}
\tf z = C\x + D\uu,
\end{equation}
for $C\in \R^{m \times n}$, $D\in \R^{m\times p}$, user specified cost matrices.  Then the closed loop map
